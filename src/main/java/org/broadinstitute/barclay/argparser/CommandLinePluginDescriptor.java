/**
 * A base class for descriptors for plugins that can be dynamically discovered by the
 * command line parser and specified as command line arguments. An instance of each
 * plugin descriptor to be used should be passed to the command line parser, and will
 * be queried to find the class and package names to search for all plugin classes
 * that should be discovered dynamically. The command line parser will find all such
 * classes, and delegate to the descriptor to obtain the corresponding plugin instance;
 * the object returned to the parser is then added to the parser's list of argument sources.
 *
 * Descriptors (sub)classes should have at least one @Argument used to accumulate the
 * user-specified instances of the plugin seen on the command line. Allowed values for
 * this argument are the simple class names of the discovered plugin subclasses.
 *
 * Plugin (sub)classes:
 *
 * - should subclass a common base class (the name of which is returned by the descriptor)
 * - may live in any one of the packages returned by the descriptor {@Link #getPackageNames},
 *   but must have a unique simple name to avoid command line name collisions.
 * - should contain @Arguments for any values they wish to collect. @Arguments may be
 *   optional or required. If required, the arguments are in effect "provisionally
 *   required" in that they are contingent on the specific plugin being specified on
 *   the command line; they will only be marked by the command line parser as missing
 *   if the they have not been specified on the command line, and the plugin class
 *   containing the plugin argument *has* been specified on the command line (as
 *   determined by the command line parser via a call to isDependentArgumentAllowed).
 *
 * NOTE: plugin class @Arguments that are marked "optional=false" should be not have a primitive
 * type, and should not have an initial value, as the command line parser will interpret these as
 * having been set even if they have not been specified on the command line. Conversely, @Arguments
 * that are optional=true should have an initial value, since they parser will not require them
 * to be set in the command line.
 *
 * The methods for each descriptor are called in the following order:
 *
 *  getPluginClass()/getPackageNames() - once when argument parsing begins (if the descriptor
 *  has been passed to the command line parser as a target descriptor)
 *
 *  getClassFilter() - once for each plugin subclass found
 *  getInstance() - once for each plugin subclass that isn't filtered out by getClassFilter
 *  validateDependentArgumentAllowed  - once for each plugin argument value that has been
 *  specified on the command line for a plugin that is controlled by this descriptor
 *
 *  validateArguments() - once when argument parsing is complete
 *  getAllInstances() - whenever the pluggable class consumer wants the resulting plugin instances
 *
 *  getAllowedValuesForDescriptorArgument is only called when the command line parser is constructing
 *  a help/usage message.
